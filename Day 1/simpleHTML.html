    <h1>Top 3 horror Visual Novel of all time</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>1. Corpse Party</h2>
    <i>"Death comes in a variety of flavors."</i>
    <p>imagine watching a horror film. Its atmosphere and violence tug at your gut, inciting unease over the brutal
        suffering of characters you've grown to love. As you sit, perched on the edge of your chair, the hero stumbles
        down a hallway running from certain death that claws at his feet. At the last moment, just when he hopes to
        escape, he dies. A grisly death.
    </p>
    <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/251270/header.jpg?t=1589524583" alt="corpse-party.jpg">
    <p>But he wasn't supposed to die at that particular point in the film. So you rewind the movie and re-watch the last
        20 minutes leading into his untimely demise hoping that something changes along the way. This is the Corpse
        Party experience. For all its unique, gory, unsettling moments of horror, sudden "Game Overs" undo some of the
        tension that this PSP download works so hard to build. And yet even in fits of frustration, the atmosphere of
        Corpse Party still haunts the mind and demonstrates the power of simple visuals paired with effective text and
        sound.
    </p>
    <p>Corpse Party came into existence in 1996 when a team of independent Japanese developers used the RPG Maker suite
        to craft a 16-bit horror game. In the many years following, Corpse Party would return in different forms --
        notably an upgraded PSP remake that added new visuals, music, and characters to the original. The version of
        Corpse Party released on the PlayStation Network represents this complete version, localized for the first time
        for a western audience.
    </p>
    <p>The story of Corpse Party starts late at night in Kisaragi Academy, a normal Japanese high school. While telling
        ghost stories together, a group of students decide to perform a ritual to ensure their friendship endures over
        time. Immediately after performing the incantations, an earthquake devastates the school and the friends find
        themselves in the dilapidated Heavenly Host Elementary School -- a building demolished decades earlier.
    </p>
    <p>Over the next 10 hours (give or take), your job is to keep these friends alive while navigating the cursed halls
        of Heavenly Host. Blood, hunger, and betrayal threaten the sanity of each character and any action you take
        could lead right into death's waiting arms.
    </p>
    <p>In keeping with Corpse Party's 16-bit roots, the visuals you'll find here stay with simple 2D sprites and
        backgrounds, which might seem odd compared to modern horror games. But shortly after its opening sequence Corpse
        Party reveals its greatest strength: it gives you just enough details to chill you, and leaves the rest up to
        your imagination.
    </p>
    <p>Corpse Party toys with text and sound in ways that most video games today just don't do. I couldn't imagine
        playing it without a top-of-the-line pair of headphones. Voices flicker and echo between your ears, black
        screens and textual cues ignite your senses of smell and touch -- even the music will react to the sight of a
        dead body. Playing Corpse Party means investing as much time in reading and listening as you do in controlling a
        character and searching objects.
    </p>
    <p>The frustration comes from hitting one of Corpse Party's many dead ends. You might interact with the wrong
        object, get caught by a ghost, or just do things out of order -- all lead to the actual death of the characters
        (in gruesome detail) and a reloaded save file. This might set you back 20 minutes, and with no way to skip
        previously read dialogue and cutscenes, repeated deaths can push even the most peaceful player to bouts of
        gaming rage.
    </p>
    <p>This issue aggravates further because these deaths come at unexpected points with no warning to help protect
        players from a slight misstep. Sometimes Corpse Party even tricks you into these dead ends. This might enhance
        the feeling of suspense during play, but it makes each death a serious time investment -- unusual for a portable
        platform normally reserved for bite-sized sessions.

    <h2>2. YOU and ME and HER: A Love Story</h2>
    <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1293820/header.jpg?t=1590433333" alt="you-me-her.jpg">

    <i>"We only get one shot at love. One mistake and it’s all over.</i>
    <br>
    <p>Video games carry an aura of experimentation that the consequences of life cannot provide. If you fail a mission,
        you have the choice to restart and try again like nothing ever happened. If you want to complete an objective as
        efficiently as possible, you can replay that scenario over and over again. If you have the urge to pillage an
        entire village and murder all the residents in a fit of God-like rage but not endure the moral repercussions of
        your actions? Just quick load your save file of Skyrim and we won’t talk about it. The choice to erase a played
        scenario and re-do it in the fashion a player wants to is one of the more alluring aspects of video games, and
        one of the reasons players can feel comfortable doing terrible things without second guessing the actions: it’s
        just a game, right? No one gets hurt in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>Visual novels are a connoisseur of this allure of choice. Most novels will provide multiple endings, expected to
        be explored, reloaded, and experienced. These characters face a multitude of emotions: love, hate, jealousy,
        rage, disappointment, relief; all to be subsequently wiped for the player to play through the story once again.
        These range of emotions the characters inquire are deleted after each load, wiped clean to encounter once again
        for the very first time. But what if these characters knew of your actions? Knew how many times you reneged on
        promises made to see the other side of the coin? When the characters realized how selfish your actions really
        were?
    </p>
    <p>YOU and ME and HER revolves around the high school lives of Susuki Shinichi, the main protagonist, his childhood
        friend, Sone Miyuki, and their mysterious classmate, Mukou Aoi. Aoi is often found on the school rooftop
        clutching a clam-shell phone trying to phone God at her self-proclaimed “center of the universe”. This stance
        has caused her to unceremoniously be the loner of the class. Shinichi sees her ways on the roof as he frequents
        there for class clean-up duties, and offers to extend a hand in friendship to a girl who looks in need of help,
        but is unsure how to ask.
    </p>
    <p>Miyuki, on the other hand, boasts herself as the queen bee of the classroom, a perfect individual who can
        befriend all with her gentle demeanor, but keeps all who covet her past arm’s distance. She glides into each
        facet of life with determination and grace, a life built to be above others, to be the best she can be. Miyuki
        is seen as an unattainable goal to Shinichi, one that is nauseatingly pounded into submission throughout the
        first half of the game, and Shinichi actively keeps his distance from her, avoiding contact outside of school in
        order to make sure he stays romantically unavailable, lest someone of her caliber is seen with a loser as
        self-stated by himself.

    <br>
    <p>The first half of Y&M&H carries on as your run-of-the-mill visual novel standard, though the inclusion of full
        Japanese audio is a welcoming touch. A near-insufferable protagonist downplaying obvious advances from a
        tsundere secondary, and your weirdly kinky friend, enter Akebono Yuutarou, who plays hit-or-miss comic relief as
        filler in between plot lines. The writing feels very one-tone and the only real stand out is Aoi, who during
        your first route feels oddly “4th wall” about her knowledge in regards to visual novels and the tropes around
        them. While Y&M&H does provide multiple endings to experience, the way the choices are presented feel catered to
        reach a specific ending for one of the two main female characters.
    </p>
    <p>When you start digging into the other character’s route, the game almost feels like it’s pushing you away from
        it, to go back to what has been played and accomplished before, before you go against the enjoyable feeling of
        being wanted and seeing two souls finally intertwine. Talks of “breaking routes” and “only being the friend in
        this game” fill the route, subtly second guessing player actions, little breaks in the 4th wall with reminders
        to save your progress: actions that during any other novel may seem suspect.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://pixeldie.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/1293820_20200530204844_1.png">
    <br>
    <p>When Y&M&H initially boots up, the game states that it contains mature themes including violence and language,
        and if you’re familiar with nitroplus‘ Saya no Uta, you know what is capable. After a very tame first act, the
        end of the second main route grips the proverbial E-brake and hits a loud, abrupt 180, putting the characters,
        scenes, and the overall state of the game on a wild turn down to the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>The writing is razor sharp, and the atmosphere is substantially tense. I commend nitroplus‘ added additions to
        the genre’s normally static exterior, but the tasks at hand for the protagonist can involve a lot of trial and
        error and are not presented very clearly, which will have you fumbling around to figure out your next move. One
        of the coolest pieces of Y&M&H will take you by surprise, since where your experiences with a visual novel are
        held specific to you, Y&M&H‘s choices and details of the story itself are also specific to you. Pay attention to
        the lives you play with.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://pixeldie.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/1293820_20200530231330_1.png">
    <br>
    <p>Soon you reach the end of their journey: one filled with love, tears, jealousy, and many, many more emotions.
        Despite the world once seeming so one-dimensional, Y&M&H tosses and turns it in ways I haven’t seen in recent
        years. Never has a title made me question the morality in which players treat the characters whom set the stage
        since Spec Ops: The Line. Y&M&H pleads with you to stand firm with your choices, to understand the promises that
        were made throughout your playthrough, and to hold true the emotions felt.
    </p>
    <p>For every coin, there are two sides: one must be called, and the choice must be kept.</p>
    <p>So, which will you choose?</p>

    <h2>3. Doki Doki Literature Club</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/698780/header.jpg?t=1586800322" alt="monika.jpg">
    <br>
    <i>"The lady who knows everything."</i>
    <p>From the outside Doki Doki Literature Club looks like your average dating sim/visual novel. Cute girls to bicker
        and fight for the protagonist’s affections: check. Cute and ditzy stereotype: check. Quiet and shy stereotype:
        check. Hard on the outside but soft and cute on the inside stereotype: check. All accounted for. However, the
        game makes it very clear from the outset, with its warning message, that Doki Doki has much to find and offer
        behind its sweet and cuddly facade.
    </p>
    <p>For anybody that doesn’t enjoy or usually play visual novels and dating sims (raises hand), Doki Doki can be
        quite the hard sell. You are instantly greeted by bright and vibrant colours, anime art styles and the same
        bubbly music on a constant loop. There is a lot, and I mean a lot, of text to read through, no voice acting to
        share the workload, and each character has about two sprites each which are recycled and rotated heavily. In
        short, all of the things you would expect from a visual novel. The game takes the largest chunk of its playtime
        setting up the dating sim formula and adhering to tropes and stereotypes of the genre. Whilst this part probably
        takes a little too long to get through, it is vital to the experience that will be had by the end of the game.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://www.gamegrin.com/assets/Uploads/dokilit1.jpg" alt="dokidoki.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>The first section introduces you to the four girls of the school's literature club, of which you are coerced into
        joining, despite having no interest in the subject. The first girl is Sayori, a childhood friend and neighbour
        who you have grown apart from. Sayori is the girl who introduces you to the club and has a clumsy and cute
        personality. The second girl is Monica, the president of the literature club. She is a popular student who
        decided to tackle the challenges of starting her own club she is passionate about, rather than deal with the
        politics she experienced in an already established club. The third girl is Natsuki, she is the youngest of the
        group and therefore always feels like she has the most to prove. Her hard and defensive exterior masks her soft
        interior. The final member is Yuri who is shy, nervous and introverted. Her passion for literature however,
        allows her to express herself in ways she finds difficult in her daily life. The main concept of the game
        (except for reading) is that as part of the club you have to write your own poetry. This essentially boils down
        to picking choice words, with each of the possible options having an affinity with a particular girl. So in
        essence you are writing poetry for the girl of your choice. Welcome to the world of dating sims.
    </p>
    <p>The task of writing poetry not only allows you to determine the lady you will choose, but also allows you to
        delve deeper into the psyche of the four girls. I genuinely cared about the characters and that is a testament
        to the standard of writing. Yes, there is a lot to read but when it is this well written, it makes the
        experience both engaging and fulfilling. There is a part in the game, later on, as the mood and story darken
        where swear words are used in the dialogue. Even though I was reading the text, and there was no voice acting,
        these occasions had such a huge impact on me. They were a clear reflection of the route this game was taking and
        the tone it was setting. I usually don’t appreciate swear words in a game as it can be an indicator of lazy
        writing or used in such abundance it becomes irritating, which is not the case here.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://www.gamegrin.com/assets/Uploads/dokilit4.jpg" alt="Natsuki.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>The game is a definite slow burner and takes its time to get to the meaty and gripping parts of the story. This
        allows it to lay its foundations, build its connections and set its expectations, all so it can subvert them and
        shock you later on. When things turn, and boy do they turn, Doki Doki is hard hitting. The warning message at
        the start of the game is there for a reason. It tackles very relevant issues in depression and anxiety, and is
        very vivid in its approach, it does not shy away at all. Being so front and centre with such themes, which are
        very relatable, is a very uncommon practice in video games. Although these are extreme examples and used
        basically to be the foundation of a horror game, I really appreciated the approach that was taken here.
