        <p>Cicuta maculata is a highly poisonous species of flowering plant in the carrot family known by several common
            names, including spotted water hemlock, spotted parsley, spotted cowbane, and the suicide root by the
            Iroquois. It is native to nearly all of North America, from northern Canada to southern Mexico. It is a
            rhizomatous perennial herb producing a hollow erect stem to a maximum height between 1 and 1.5 metres (3 ft
            3 in and 4 ft 11 in). The long leaves are made up of several lance-shaped, pointed, serrated leaflets. Each
            shiny green leaflet is 2 to 10 centimetres (1 to 4 in) long and the entire leaf may be up to 40 centimetres
            (16 in) long. The inflorescence of white flowers is similar in appearance to other species in the carrot
            family. It is a compound umbel with many clusters of flowers. The dry tan-brown fruit is a few millimeters
            long.</p><br />
        <h2>Toxicity</h2><br />
        <p>The plant is occasionally mistaken for parsnips, due to its clusters of white tuberous roots; this is an
            often fatal error, as the Cicuta is extremely poisonous. It is considered to be North America's most toxic
            plant.</p><br />
        <p>Cicuta is fatal when swallowed, causing violent and painful convulsions. Though a number of people have died
            from water hemlock poisoning over the centuries, livestock have long been the worst affected (hence the name
            "cowbane"), causing death in as little as 15 minutes.</p><br />
        <p>The chief poison is cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is most concentrated in the roots. Upon
            human consumption, nausea, vomiting, and tremors occur within 30–60 minutes, followed by severe cramps,
            projectile vomiting, and convulsions. Occasional long-term effects include retrograde amnesia. Ingestion
            of water hemlock in any quantity can result in death or permanent damage to the central nervous system.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Symptoms</h2><br />
        <p>Upon consumption, both in humans and other species, the symptoms of poisoning are mainly characterized by
            generalized seizures. The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post
            ingestion. Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremors, confusion,
            weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness; although the rapid onset of seizure activity may be the first
            sign presented following poisoning. Seizures are usually described as clonic or tonic–clonic.
            Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases in the pH of the
            blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown
            (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure. Additional neurological symptoms may include
            hallucinations, delirium, tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, and
            coma. Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and
            high blood pressure. Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR
            interval, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of excess
            salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing have also been reported.</p><br />

        <p>Deaths usually occur from respiratory failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure
            activity; fatalities have occurred within a few hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover
            usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48 hours of poisoning, although seizures may
            persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the
            events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may
            include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may
            take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Diagnosis and treatment</h2><br />
        <p>Initial treatment of poisoning may include gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal.
            Decontamination is typically only performed if a potentially toxic amount of plant matter has been ingested
            up to one hour previously and the patient has a normal intact airway or has been intubated. There is no
            specific antidote for water hemlock poisoning and treatment mainly consists of supportive care. Treatment
            may include control of seizures with the administration of a benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam,
            or if seizures are refractory to this treatment, a barbiturate such as phenobarbital is administered. The
            anticonvulsant phenytoin is not recommended as it has not been shown to be effective for seizure control
            following water hemlock poisoning. Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines or barbiturates may
            cause respiratory depression and respiratory support including intubation and mechanical ventilation is
            required in these patients. Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is recommended in symptomatic
            patients.</p><br/>
