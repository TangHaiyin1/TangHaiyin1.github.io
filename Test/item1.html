        <p>Atropa belladonna, commonly known as belladonna or deadly nightshade, is a poisonous perennial herbaceous
            plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant (aubergine). It
            is native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. Its distribution extends from Great Britain in the west
            to western Ukraine and the Iranian province of Gilan in the east. It is also naturalised or introduced in
            some parts of Canada and the United States.</p><br />
        <p>The foliage and berries are extremely toxic when ingested, containing tropane alkaloids. These toxins
            include atropine, scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which cause delirium and hallucinations, and are
            also used as pharmaceutical anticholinergics. These tropane alkaloids appear to be common in the family
            Solanaceae, as they are also present in plants of the genera Brugmansia, Datura and Hyoscyamus, of the same
            family but in different subfamilies and tribes than the nightshade.</p><br />
        <p>Atropa belladonna has unpredictable effects. The antidote for belladonna poisoning is physostigmine or
            pilocarpine, the same as for atropine.</p><br />
        <h2>Description</h2><br />
        <p>Atropa belladonna is a branching herbaceous perennial rhizomatous hemicryptophyte, often growing as a
            subshrub from a fleshy rootstock. Plants grow to 2 m (7 ft) tall with ovate leaves 18 cm (7 in) long. The
            bell-shaped flowers are dull purple with green tinges and faintly scented. The fruits are berries, which are
            green, ripening to a shiny black, and approximately 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in diameter. The berries are sweet and
            are consumed by animals that disperse the seeds in their droppings, even though they contain toxic
            alkaloids. (See Toxicity)[13] There is a pale-yellow flowering form called Atropa belladonna var. lutea with
            pale yellow fruit.</p><br />
        <h2>Distribution</h2><br />
        <p>Atropa belladonna is native to temperate southern, Central and Eastern Europe; North Africa, Turkey, Iran and
            the Caucasus, but has been cultivated and introduced outside its native range. In southern Sweden it was
            recorded in Flora of Skåne in 1870 as grown in apothecary gardens near Malmö.</p><br />
        <p>In Britain it is native only on calcareous soils, on disturbed ground, field margins, hedgerows and open
            woodland. More widespread as an alien, it is often a relic of cultivation as a medicinal herb. Seed is
            spread mainly by birds.</p><br />
        <p>It is naturalized in parts of North America, where it is often found in shady, moist locations with
            limestone-rich soils. It is considered a weed species in parts of the world, where it colonizes areas
            with disturbed soils.</p><br />

        <h2>Toxicity</h2><br />
        <p>Belladonna is one of the most toxic plants found, and its use by mouth increases risk in numerous
            clinical conditions, such as complications of pregnancy, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal
            disorders, and psychiatric disorders, among others. All parts of the plant contain tropane
            alkaloids. Roots have up to 1.3%, leaves 1.2%, stalks 0.65%, flowers 0.6%, ripe berries 0.7%, and
            seeds 0.4% tropane alkaloids;[clarification needed] leaves reach maximal alkaloid content when the plant is
            budding and flowering, roots are most poisonous in the end of the plant's vegetation period. Belladonna
            nectar is transformed by bees into honey that also contains tropane alkaloids. The berries pose the
            greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste. The
            root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The active agents in belladonna, atropine, hyoscine (scopolamine), and hyoscyamine, have anticholinergic
            properties. The symptoms of belladonna poisoning include dilated pupils, sensitivity to light,
            blurred vision, tachycardia, loss of balance, staggering, headache, rash, flushing, severely dry mouth and
            throat, slurred speech, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and
            convulsions. In 2009, A. belladonna berries were mistaken for blueberries by an adult woman;
            the six berries she ate were documented to result in severe anticholinergic syndrome. The plant's deadly
            symptoms are caused by atropine's disruption of the parasympathetic nervous system's ability to regulate
            involuntary activities, such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate. The antidote for belladonna poisoning
            is an anticholinesterase (such as physostigmine or pilocarpine), the same as for atropine.</p><br />
        <p>Atropa belladonna is also toxic to many domestic animals, causing narcosis and paralysis. However, cattle
            and rabbits eat the plant seemingly without suffering harmful effects. In humans, its anticholinergic
            properties will cause the disruption of cognitive capacities, such as memory and learning.</p><br/>
