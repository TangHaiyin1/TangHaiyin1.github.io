        <p class="zero">This item has been moved to clearance due to it not upholding to the quality standards of the
            licensor, Team
            Salvato. These pins have some manufacturing defects that cause the style to deviate from the original
            in-game
            chibi art. Most notably, this includes inaccurate color-matching, outlining, and shading.</p>
        <p class="zero">If you don't mind a bit of divination from the original artwork, these pins make for a fun,
            budget-friendly
            accessory! Give your bag, lanyard, backpack, or other items some literary flare with these lapel renditions
            of
            the DDLC cast.</p>
