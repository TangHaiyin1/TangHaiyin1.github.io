    <h2>Claustrophobia</h2>
    <p id="doanvan1" class="paragraph">Claustrophobia is a situational phobia triggered by an irrational and intense
        fear of tight or crowded spaces. It can be triggered by things like being locked in a windowless room, being
        stuck in a crowded elevator, or driving on a congested highway.

        Claustrophobia is one of the most common phobias. If you experience claustrophobia, you may feel like you’re
        having a panic attack, although claustrophobia isn’t a panic disorder. For some people, claustrophobia may
        disappear on its own. Others may need therapy to manage and cope with their symptoms.</p>
    <h2>Hemophobia</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Does the sight of blood make you feel faint or anxious? Maybe the very thought of undergoing
        certain medical
        procedures involving blood makes you feel sick to your stomach.

        The term for the irrational fear of blood is hemophobia. It falls under the category of “specific phobia” with
        the specifier of blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia in the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
        of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

        While some people may feel uneasy about blood from time to time, hemophobia is an extreme fear of seeing blood,
        or getting tests or shots where blood may be involved. This phobia can have a serious impact on your life,
        especially if you skip important doctor appointments as a result.</p>
    <h2>Autophobia</h2>
    <p>Autophobia, or monophobia, is the fear of being alone or lonely. Being alone, even in a usually comforting place
        like home, can result in severe anxiety for people with this condition. People with autophobia feel they need
        another person or other people around in order to feel safe.</p>
    <h2>Alektorophobia</h2>
    <p>Alektorophobia is a rare condition characterized by an intense fear of chickens. The word comes from the Greek
        words “alektor,” which means rooster, and “phobos,” which means fear.

        It’s considered a specific phobia. This refers to an irrational fear of a specific object, place, or situation.
        People with phobias usually understand that their fear is irrational, but they’re unable to control their
        intense physical or psychological reaction.</p>
